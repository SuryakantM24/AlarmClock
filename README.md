# Alarm Clock App

A simple alarm clock web application that allows users to create and manage multiple alarms. The app features a 12-hour clock format with AM/PM indicators and plays an alarm sound when the specified alarm time is reached. Users can add alarms, pause alarms, and delete upcoming alarms. If an alarm is not stopped manually, it will automatically stop after 1 minute and show an alert in the browser. The design is implemented using CSS and HTML, utilizing concepts like linear gradients, flexbox, and CSS position property. The application logic is written in Vanilla JavaScript without the use of any additional frameworks.
